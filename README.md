Introduction:

YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing:

The project utilizes SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to create a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, store, and query YouTube channel and video data.

Installation and Technologies involved in this project:

1) Install Python:
   Python is a programming language used for building applications and scripting tasks.
2) YouTube API:
   Google API is used to retrieve data from YouTube channels and videos.
3) MongoDB:
  A NoSQL Database is used as a data lake for storing retrieved youtube data.
4) SQL:
  A relational database used as a data warehouse for storing migrated youtube data.
5) Pandas:
  A data manipulation library is used for data processing and analysis.
6) Streamlit:
  A Python library used for creating interactive web applications and data visualizations.

Project Description:

Once the project is set up and running, users can access the streamlit application through a web browser. The application will provide a user interface where users can perform the following actions:

a)	Enter the YouTube channel ID to retrieve data for that channel.
b)	Store the retrieved data in the MongoDB data lake.
c)	Collect and store data for multiple YouTube channels in the data lake.
d)	Select a channel and migrate its data from the data lake to the SQL data warehouse.
e)	Search and retrieve data from SQL databases using search options.
f)	Perform data analysis and visualization using provided features.



Conclusion:

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project provides a powerful tool for retrieving, storing, and analyzing YouTube channel and video data. By leveraging SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, users can easily access and manipulate YouTube data in a user-friendly interface. The project offers flexibility, scalability, and data visualization capabilities, empowering users to gain insights from the vast amount of YouTube data available.
